# Address Gemini Code Review

This skill fetches recent GitHub PRs from `devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms`, reads Gemini code review
comments, and helps address them by making the suggested fixes in the codebase.

## Repository

- **GitHub**: `devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms`
- **CLI**: All operations use `gh` CLI

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Recent PRs

List recent open PRs:

```bash
gh pr list --repo devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms --limit 10
```

List recently merged PRs:

```bash
gh pr list --repo devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms --state merged --limit 10
```

Show a specific PR's details:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms
```

### Step 2: Fetch Review Comments

Get all review comments on a PR (includes Gemini and other reviewers):

```bash
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments
```

Get top-level PR reviews (approve/request changes/comment):

```bash
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews
```

Get issue-level comments (non-inline):

```bash
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/issues/<PR_NUMBER>/comments
```

### Step 3: Filter Gemini Comments

Gemini code review comments come from a bot account. Filter by identifying
the bot user. Common Gemini bot identifiers:

- Username contains `gemini` or `google-gemini`
- The `user.type` field is `"Bot"`
- The comment body often includes structured feedback with severity levels

When parsing comments, extract:
- **File path** (`path` field) — which file the comment is on
- **Line number** (`line` or `original_line` field) — which line
- **Diff hunk** (`diff_hunk` field) — surrounding code context
- **Body** (`body` field) — the actual review feedback
- **Severity** — Gemini often labels issues as `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`

### Step 4: Categorize and Prioritize

Group Gemini comments by severity and type:

| Priority | Types | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **P0 — Fix now** | Bugs, security issues, crashes | Fix immediately |
| **P1 — Should fix** | Performance, error handling, logic issues | Fix in this PR |
| **P2 — Consider** | Style, naming, minor improvements | Fix if quick, else note for later |
| **P3 — Optional** | Nitpicks, suggestions, alternatives | Acknowledge, skip if not valuable |

### Step 5: Address Each Comment

For each comment that needs action:

1. **Read the file** at the referenced path and line
2. **Understand the suggestion** — what Gemini is asking to change and why
3. **Evaluate validity** — Gemini can be wrong. Check if the suggestion actually applies:
   - Does the suggested pattern match the project's conventions?
   - Is the "bug" actually a bug, or is Gemini misunderstanding context?
   - Does the performance suggestion matter at the project's scale?
4. **Make the fix** if valid, following the project's existing patterns
5. **Skip with reason** if invalid — explain to the user why the suggestion doesn't apply

### Step 6: Report Summary

After addressing comments, provide a summary:

```markdown
## Gemini Review Summary — PR #<NUMBER>

### Addressed
- [file:line] <what was fixed and why>
- [file:line] <what was fixed and why>

### Skipped (with reason)
- [file:line] <suggestion> — Skipped: <reason>

### Needs Discussion
- [file:line] <suggestion> — <why this needs human decision>
```

## Useful gh CLI Commands Reference

```bash
# List open PRs
gh pr list --repo devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms

# View specific PR with diff
gh pr view <N> --repo devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms
gh pr diff <N> --repo devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms

# Get PR review comments (inline code comments)
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/pulls/<N>/comments

# Get PR reviews (top-level approve/reject)
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/pulls/<N>/reviews

# Get PR issue comments (conversation-level)
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/issues/<N>/comments

# Filter comments by bot user with jq
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/pulls/<N>/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.type == "Bot" or (.user.login | test("gemini";"i")))]'

# Get just comment bodies with file context
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/pulls/<N>/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.type == "Bot") | {path, line, body}'

# Reply to a review comment
gh api repos/devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms/pulls/<N>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in <commit_sha>"

# Check PR checks/status
gh pr checks <N> --repo devanfer02/telnetquiz-cms
```

## Behavioral Rules

1. **Always fetch fresh data** — don't rely on cached PR state
2. **Show the user what Gemini said** before making changes — present the categorized list first
3. **Don't blindly apply all suggestions** — evaluate each against project conventions
4. **Preserve existing patterns** — if Gemini suggests a pattern that contradicts the project's established approach, flag it rather than changing
5. **Group related fixes** — if multiple comments touch the same file, batch the edits
6. **Ask before large refactors** — if a suggestion would require changes across many files, get user approval first
